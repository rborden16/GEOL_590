Introduction: I wanted to find out whether diamonds increase in price with increasing carats.
Methods:  I used the dsmall table, which is a subset of the larger diamonds dataset. I made a plot of carat vs price. I also colored and facet-wrapped by the cut value. Results: The plots all show an increase in price with increasing carats.
Discussion: Diamonds do increase in price with increasing carats.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1410)
dsmall <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 100), ]
```
```{r}
savePlot <- function(task6plot) {
        pdf("task6plot.png")
        print(task6plot)
        dev.off()
}
```



```{r}
task6plot <- ggplot(dsmall, aes(price, carat, color = cut, )) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~cut)
print(task6plot)
savePlot(task6plot)
```
